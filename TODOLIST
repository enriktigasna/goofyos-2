Immediate concerns:
- Create struct that includes flags for interrupts
- Include this struct in the table, and initialize interrupt entire vector in init_idt
- Create basic ISR for Breakpoint, Double fault, Page fault

Plans:
- Make fun allocators

Long term:
- Remove limine provided headers for stdint.h etc., write own
